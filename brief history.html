            <p><b>CONT'D</b></p>
            <p>So he subsequently intensified prayers to God to make the new dream a reality. When he got back from Ilorin, he began to search for building which could serve as a temporary site for the proposed school.
                An uncompleted building at Nagazi uvete which belonged to one Mr Bello Osuwa of Osisi was rented as the school temporary site.
            </p>
            <p>On 5th February 1996, the proprietor commenced evening extra mural classes for nursery and primary children as part of the efforts to birth the dream. </p>
            <p>At the initial stage there were no adequate seats, and the few ones available were borrowed from neighbouring houses. This was in addition to few make-shift benches personally constructed by the proprietor. </p>
            <p>As the number of children increased in the lessons, so was the awareness getting spread like wildfire among the Nagazi-uvete populace and the neighbouring communities.
                On the 9th of September 1996, the full session of the school kicked off with 10 Pupils. The population steadily rose to eighty as the term progressed.
                The pupils were subsequently divided into 3 classes, viz: Nursery 1, Nursery 2 and Primary 1.
            </p>
            <p>The proprietor was the first Head teacher of the school. He was ably supported by 4 staff, namely;  Godwin Dare, Akin Ogunyemi, Khadijat Ahmed and Mary Sadiku.
                On 2nd November 1996, the school purchased a piece of land, measuring 150ft by 200ft meant for her permanent site at Eika Adagu Layout. This was made possible by the funds provided by missionary friends, Mr &amp; Mrs Dick Bower who had just retired from ECWA Church Kuroko and returned to their homeland in United States.
            </p> 
            <p>On 27th February 1997, the school commenced her approval registration with the Kogi State Ministry of Education, with the arrival of a team of Inspectors from the Adavi Area Inspectorate of Education(AIE).
                This was followed by the Inspection team from the state Ministry of Education, Lokoja. The school eventually got her operational approval from the state Government on 7th August, 1997, just about a year of starting operation as a full-fledged school.
            </p>     
            <p>It needs to be recalled here that the school began out of nothing, except the subsequent financial support by God-sent Bowers, which helped tremendously in alleviating the teething problems of the new school.</p>
            <p><b>Aims & Objectives of the School</b></p> 
            <p>The Mikab Model Nursery & Primary school aims at giving every child standard and quality education. It aims at making children learn fast through innovative ideas of teaching, and developing children's physical and mental skills.</p>
            <p>It also aims at creating in every child self-awareness, so as to help them develop their individual potentials.</p>
            <p><b>The School Emblem</b></p>
            <p>The school emblem is a rock, upon which stands a book, while the sunrise is situated beyond the horizon ( i.e behind the book).</p>
            <p>The  rock symbolizes Christ the solid Rock, upon which the entire school is resting. The Book represents the school as well as education. While the sunrise symbolically refers to the hope of a better future for the pupils.</p>
            <p><b>The School Motto</b></p>
            <p>The school motto is: Learning Par Excellence! This is the summation of the ultimate vision of the founding father. Mikab School dreams of the ultimate top. The vision is resolute - to give all our pupils the best in education.</p>
            <p><b>The School Name</b></p>
            <p>The name MIKAB is a phonetic combination of the proprietor's name: Michael(Mike) Enebe. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>THE MAKING OF MIKAB MODEL COLLEGE</b></p>
            <p> Mikab Model College was founded on 30th September, 2002 by Michael and Veronica Enebe.</p>
            <p>The birth of the College was sequel to the outstanding success of the Nursery and Primary arms of the school which had earlier been founded in 1996.  With the academic feat of the latter, the birth of the College became inevitable with a little prompting.</p>
            <p>At the start, the College was headed by the proprietor, Michael Enebe, (M.Ed). With just an arm of Junior Secondary (JS 1), the College initially had 4 teachers namely; Charles Gorden, Kate Okologume, Esther Okolo, Gabriel Olutunwashe. The school started in a private house, adjacent to the primary school permanent site but moved into the latter on 5th July 2003 when 3 classrooms were completed there. In the year 2014 the College fully moved into her permanent site.</p>
            <p>And in 2008 it was approved by the Kogi State Ministry of Education. This was immediately followed by WAEC and NECO centre approval the same year. Before these flurry of approvals the 1st set of the College had to  write their WAEC and NECO exams at Ebira Community Secondary School Ogaminana in 2007. But with the approval by the Ministry and the National examination bodies in 2008 the 2nd set of her SS3 students wrote their WAEC and NECO examinations within the school.</p>
            <p> Ever since its establishment, the College has been making a lot of impact in the society, with so many of her products becoming graduates in various fields of endeavors. </p>
